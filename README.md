So this is a very simple version of my project idea. The original idea was a directory of local business that you can sort by area. That would require a database, which i do not currently know how to do, so i simplified into a decision helper. eventually, with more work, and more study to work out a database, i hope to finish the original plan. keeping money in your community is very important, both locally, and racially. once the original concept is complete, i hope to expand to what race and what politics own businesses. This way, if you want to keep your money in the black community, with a focus in black LGBTQ business, this tool coudl help you find them
